# Checklist for naming your app

I know how difficult it is to choose a name for your app or package to publish. Especially when it happens to change the name or icon once decided and published.   

Hence I have decided to keep a checklist to help everyone.   

Feel free to add your own check item.

- [ ] Does your app name already picked up by a popular product(including products you find in costco.)   
- [ ] Does it imply any bad or misunderstandable meaning in any of the languages around the world   
Google translate may help you here. Rememeber, Same language but different slang => different meaning.
- [ ] Does your app name give appropriate meaning when we use it in a sentence (of any language)
- [ ] Does a same/similar/suitable website domain name available   
- [ ] Does any other app(May be unpopular or regionally popular) already available in your targetted platform   
- [ ] Does any other app available in other platform/package index/appstore thats not your targetted one   
- [ ] Is your app name copyrighted or already trade marked   
- [ ] Does your app icon resembles an existing app
- [ ] IF your app name is an abbreviation. Did you try to find possible other expansions.
- [ ] Can your app icon can conveniently be used as mobile app icon, website favicon, desktop icon, banners, product review sites
- [ ] Did you check, how your app icon looks in night mode or color invert mode or dark mode.
